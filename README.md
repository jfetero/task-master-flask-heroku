# First ever flask web-app

This project my very first web app using Python and the Flask framework that is deplyed using Heroku. [Click here to visit web app](https://task-master-jf.herokuapp.com/)

## What is it?

Because I just recently started learning about web apps, I wanted to go super simple for my first project. This project is a personalized to-do list app with an account system and a phone/email messaging alerting system that can be customized by the user. I also included email forms that are directly sent to my personal account.
The files above are specific to the heroku deployment because I had to change to postgres database from a local sqlite3 database in order to keep the data persistent. I also added worker.py in order for the alert feature to continously run in the background without really slowing down the app. [Click here for local version](https://github.com/jfetero/task-master-flask).

## Why this project?

The 2 main reasons why I chose to do this project is because I was always interested in being able to create my own website and customize it however I want, and also I am planning on applying for internships over the summer and did not really have suitable projects. When I was searching up project ideas and landed on this project, most of the other to-do list apps were boring and just displayed a table or displayed a list of tasks on a basic black and white page. To make it my own, I decided to make it feel like a real website with a landing page, home page, settings page, and a contact/about me page. I also decided to include the account system and the alert system later on to make it feel a little more legit. 

## What I learned?

I honestly learned a lot during the process of creating this project. I had zero HTML, CSS and FLask knowledge prior to this project. I just learned as I went through the struggle trying to make the app work. It took me about a full week just creating the app and then a couple more days deploying it, because I also did not know how to use Heroku and I needed to tweak a little more than I wanted to with the code. Even though I struggled even at the end of me creating this app, I am thankful for all the available resources around the web that help me pull this project off. Here is a list of things I learned making this this app.
	- Flask
	- Sqlite3
	- Bootstrap
	- How a web app actually works with post and get
	- HTML and CSS
	- Email and phone alerts
	- Deploying web app 
	- How to trouble shoot and debug
	- How to efficiently go through the web to find solutions for your problems

## Final Thoughts

I am very proud of this project being that this is my very first web app and that I learned how to do this on the fly without watching a 5 hour long tutorial beforehand. Even though this project is useless and very sub-par, this gave me even more motivation to continue learning more and more about the different fields of Computer Science.
